<h2>Prologue</h2>
<p style="line-height: 2";>She was the little princess of Kanterbury. You'll meet her on Heavenhold after 10 years have passed. The little princess who used to dash around the Heavenhold now became an adult.</p><br>
<p style="line-height: 2">You, the Guardian took the adventure to the Rah Empire then never came back. It made the little princess anxious. She remembered leaving cheerful message to you when you called through the Rah 
Empire's payphone. You seemed fine to her back then. Whatever happened to you worried the princess. As she was very sure that the Emperor and the people of Rah Empire did some horrible stuff to you, Aisha arrived at the 
Heavenhold announcing the alliance between Rah Empire and Kanterbury Kingdom. Aisha and Shapira replied that they thought the Guardian already returned to Heavenhold.</p><br>
<p style="line-height: 2">The little princess couldn't possibly understand this sudden farewell. No one taught her that you have to accept the things you cannot understand. So the princess just waited and waited. 
Her knight always came back and greeted her first. There's no way her knight would have forgotten the duties they have promised to fulfill. The mischievous kids in Heavenhold bullied the princess telling her that 
'Your knight ran away,' or 'Your sister and the Knight ran away cuz they hate you.' She drove those kids away, with such great vigor, and then got back to the Inn to shed the tears. The sound of her sorrow made even 
Loraine sad. Rumors spread among the champions. Some said you have died. Some said you have run away. Some said you were still fulfilling the duty as the Guardian. The princess trusted no one. Only the princess was 
confident that the astray Guardian would come back. The moment her long and the most strong conviction was shattered, the princess couldn't possibly handle the pain.</p><br>
<p style="line-height: 2">Princess' tears for the missing person slowly turned into tears of hatred over the years. There were so many tragedies that could have been prevented if you were there. Heavenhold now 
became the last line of defense for humanity. Friends struck down leaving only names and graves, and the enemies never gave chance to mourn their death. Princess is now a soldier protecting the remaining humans and 
also the leader of the Resistance to bring back the forsaken world. Through the training of Knight Captain Eva, the little princess grew up to be a resolute leader. Yet how tragic it is that her innocent smile is now 
replaced with such strictness and a little bit of fatigue.</p>
